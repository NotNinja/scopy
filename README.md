[Scopy](https://github.com/Skelp/scopy) is a quick and dirty property scoping library for JavaScript that utilizes
ECMAScript 2015's `Symbol` where possible and falls back on good old trailing underscore naming conventions.

## Install

Install using the package manager for your desired environment(s):

``` bash
$ npm install --save scopy
# OR:
$ bower install --save scopy
```

You'll need to have at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and you'll only need [Bower](https://bower.io) if you want to
install that way instead of using `npm`. While equals should be compatible with all versions of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org), it is only tested against version 4 and above.
